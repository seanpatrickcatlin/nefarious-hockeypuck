# nefarious-hockeypuck
Random code, experiments, exercises from books... basically anything that is not a complete idea or that I am just tinkering on to learn.


## Why the name nefarious-hockeypuck?
You know when you go to create a new repository in github and it gives you a suggestion for the name?

Like this?

Well I thought it sounded random enough to be my repository for random code.

While reading up on react, flux, and webpack I decided I need to actually write some code.  So I am currently going through the online book http://survivejs.com  I will be following the exercises within the book and committing them here.  While I technically am writing the code, it all came from their book, so credit goes to them!  https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react
